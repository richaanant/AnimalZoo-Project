This project is a Python-based Animal Management System that tracks various animals, their associated food needs, weights, and trainers. The system allows for:

Tracking Dangerous Animals: Identifies animals whose weight is below a certain threshold (600 pounds) and prints out a warning if they are considered "dangerous".

Managing Food and Weight: Updates the food intake and weight of animals, with specific logic to ensure they need to eat more and lose weight.

Adding New Animals: Allows for the addition of new animals, updating their respective data such as name, food intake, and weight.

Generating Animal Reports: Outputs reports about the trainers associated with the animals and checks if the animals match the trainer's skills.
